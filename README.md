# Tamiya RC truck:

Here you can find the software (+ a little bit of hardware) for a RC truck. Mainly the lighting system and gear shifter.

## High level design

The truck will be build on a Tamiya chassis. Currently the plan is to make a Volvo FH 16, but like everything plans change.

The truck will consist of two systems:
1. Remote controlled steering and acceleration
2. Shifting, lighting and misc.

Why the two systems? because I can salvage an RC transmitter and reciever of an old RC car _see Hardware_, wich contains 4 channels, and if I want to add the shifting and lighting to that system too i have to buy another transmitter and reciever.

## Hardware

For the 3D model of the cabin I'm using [this model](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/architecture/volvo-fh-cub-tamiya-truck).
Printed on an Creality Ender 3 @ 205째C / 55째C in PLA. 

For the microcontroller im using an "Arduino uno" (actually a ELEGOO UNO, but it's the same thing).

To steer and accelerate the truck im using a 2.4Ghz RC setup salvaged from an old Traxxas Bandit [Traxxas 2216 reciever and transmitter](https://traxxas.com/sites/default/files/2238-2208-2209-24GHz-INST.pdf).

For the lights im just using simple 3mm and 5mm led's wired up on a breadboard (when the sofware and truck is done, I will upgrade to an PCB). In the frame of the Truck there are two simple 5V servo's, one for the steering one for the gear shifting (The servo's are 180째 but 90째 is the mechanical max). As for the main driving power a Carson 500906219 - Launcher 80 x 2 Turns DC motor is used. How I am going to power this moter, I haven't figured out jet.
